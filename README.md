## About The Project

The Idea for the project came about after I wanted to calculate something on my Ipad and I discovered Apple's Ipad doesn't have a calculator.

Then I thought to myself why not make one myself?

So this is my take on the Apple's Calculator.

## What I learned:

- How to create a string from the buttons the user presses and store it in a variable
for later use.

- a cool "Trick" with the JS slice function that makes it easy to find the last character of a string.

- That there is more to a calculator than what meets the eye :)
